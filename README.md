# Tennis Shot Recognition Model

This is a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) that is accurately able to predict where a tennis shot will land based of an input image

## Usage

To use this model to its full potential you need to pass it an image with dimensions 1100x400

An example image you would pass it looks something like this

The AImageFeeder.py will give you the perfect image every time with a screen resolution of 1920x1200

Make sure to change the file paths in AImageFeeder.py!

- Please Keep in mind that the model currently only works with forehand and backhand shots from the baseline
